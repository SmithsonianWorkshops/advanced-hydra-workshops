# `conda` hands-on

In the hands-on portion of the workshop you will learn how to use a version of conda pre-installed on Hydra to install software. At the end of the hands-on portion you'll learn:
- Where to get help with conda
- How to find software to install
- How to install software using best-practices
- How to run the software you installed with conda in submitted jobs on the Hydra
- How to configure your Hydra account to make conda available when you log on (optional)
- How to share your installations with others on Hydra and those using other systems

## Accessing conda on Hydra

In this workshop we'll be using `conda` that is pre-installed on Hydra and accessible via the module `tools/conda/23.1.0`.
Loading this module and then running `start-conda` will configure your current environment to use the conda.

To see what changes are made, we'll look at the location and version of python in your current session.

:alert: If you have previously configured to load automatically, and you have `(base)` in your command prompt when you log in, please see ____.

*Before*
```
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
````

*Load module*
```
$ module load tools/conda/23.1.0
Miniconda3 v23.1.0 loaded, to start conda, type start-conda
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
```

Unlike many modules, loading doesn't change your environment, other than creating the alias `start-conda`

Running the hydra-specific command `start-conda`, your current environment is modified to use conda. It not only changes your `PATH`, but other settings.
`(base)` in your command prompt indicates it is configured.

```
$ start-conda
(base)$ which python
/share/apps/tools/conda/23.1.0/bin/python
(base)$ python --version
Python 3.10.9
```
:warning: **You must enter the Hydra-specific command `start-conda` for conda to work!**

Discussion:
- What does `(base)` mean?
- Advanced: use `echo $PATH` to see how the `PATH` variable changes as you peform the above steps.
- This is an admin installed conda, how can I use it to install my own software!

## Using conda to install software

Different approaches:
- Conda package already exists: install package(s) and all dependencies with conda
- Packge not available
  - Install dependencies and then setup/compile program
  - If it's a Python program, use `pip` to install

We'll start with installing programs when there's already a conda package available.

### Finding packages
- anaconda.org
  - What channel?
  - What version?
- Searching using the conda program

### Create an environment

- You'll have full write-access to the environemnts you create (unlike `base` on Hydra)
- Best-practice is to create a separate environment for each pipeline
  - This will be a set of programs that need to run in your analysis steps
  - Sometimes pipeline componenets can have conflicting dependencies, you might have to create separate dependencies for these components.
- By having separate environments, dependency conflicts will be less likely
- You can also create environments for specific programs.
- Environments can be 'disposable,'... [re-create when needed]
- Environments allow users to have a different version of Python installed than what is installed in `base`

```
(base) $ conda create --name blobtools
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

Please update conda by running

    $ conda update -n base -c defaults conda

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /home/user/.conda/envs/blobtools

Proceed ([y]/n)? y

Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate blobtools
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

The output:
- `environment location: /home/user/.conda/envs/workblobtoolsshop`
  - Conda will create the environment in your home directory in a hidden directory named `.conda`
  - That's a great place for it on Hydra because it's not scrubbed
  - You can specify a different location with `--prefix /full/path/to/environment`
- `To activate this environment, use $ conda activate blobtools`: You'll next activate our new environment to start installing programs.
- `To deactivate an active environment, use $ conda deactivate`: When You're done with the enviornment, you can deactivate it, or you can close the terminal session.
- Note, you may recieve an alert that a newer version of conda is available. You won't be able to update on your own because you don't have write access to the `base` environment. The Hydra admins will occasionally install new versions of conda.

## Activate your new environment
- `conda activate blobtools`
  - Start using your new environment
  - At this point the only additional program you have is `conda`! The programs installed in `base` are *not* accessible.

```
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
```

### Channels

- Defaults (controlled by the Anaconda company): `main` and `R`
- Community moderated channels: e.g. `conda-forge`, `bioconda`
- Privately controlled channels. These can be publicly available or hidden : `dunnlab`, `faircloth-lab`, ...
  - These are not community curated, so they are more likely to be orphaned (no no longer updated) or configured specifically for the needs of an individual or lab group.

When you use conda to install a package, the configured channel(s) are checked for packages and dependencies.

You can specify multiple channels to search for the program you want to install and its dependencies.

If you are installing a package from:
- `main` or `R` (Defaults), these should be configured as the highest priority for searching for packages.
- `conda-forge` or `bioconda`, `conda-forge` should be the highest priority with `bioconda` next, followed by Defaults.
- Discussion: What about the privately maintained community repos? 

:warning::warning::warning:
If you don't have the channel priority set correctly, you can be installing dependencies that are not compatible with the package you want.

- ?? Maybe hands-on showing different verisons/sources that will be installed depending on channel list?
- Best practice?: specify the channels during install and `--overide-channels` (others?)


### Our reccomendations for settings

`conda config --set channel_priority strict` Lower priority channels are not searched to find a compatible version of a program.

Add channels in this order. `defaults` will be lowest and `conda-forge` highest. 
```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

```
$ conda config --show channels
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  - defaults
```

And you can view of your settings in the file `~/.condarc` 

```
$ cat ~/.condara
channel_priority: strict
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  - defaults
```

### Installing

```
$ conda install blobtools

Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: failed with initial frozen solve. Retrying with flexible solve.
Solving environment: failed with repodata from current_repodata.json, will retry with next repodata source.
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /home/user/.conda/envs/blobtools

  added / updated specs:
    - blobtools

...

Proceed ([y]/n)? y


Downloading and Extracting Packages

Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done

```

ðŸ•’ This will take about five minutes in the "Solving enviornment" stage.


### Add additional package

We've decided we also need to run NCBI's blast with this pipeline. We can install blast in the blobtools environment.

```
$ conda install blast
```

### Create environment and install package(s) in one step

Make sure you're back in `base`, if not deactivate you current environment

```
(blobtools)$ conda deactivate
(base)$
```

```
$ conda create --name blobtools_with_blast blobtools blast
...
```

### Installing with `pip`

[Probably best to find a different example, this one doesn't install correctly with pip and it's actually available via bioconda. Maybe use Mike's tool that calculates assembly stats?]

AMAS "Alignment manipulation and summary statistics": https://github.com/marekborowiec/AMAS
`Borowiec, M.L. 2016. AMAS: a fast tool for alignment manipulation and computing of summary statistics. PeerJ 4:e1660.` http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1660

- Not available on anacaonda.org [actually it is, whoops]
- Instructions say:
  - `sudo apt-get install python3` and `pip install amas`
  - `sudo` on Hydra is a red flag, you don't have sudo rights!
  - `apt-get` assumes you are running the Ubuntu flavor of Linux, which Hydra is not!

Our strategy: create a conda env with python3 and install amas into that env

```
$ conda create -n amas python=3
```

```
$ conda activate amas
```

```
$ pip install amas
```

Where did the executable go? /home/user/.conda/envs/amas-try2/lib/python3.11/site-packages/amas/AMAS.py
Well, maybe this isn't the best example :(

## Using your conda environment in a job

```
module load tools/conda/23.1.0
start-conda
conda activate <name>
```

## Exporting and sharing your environment

- Others can load your conda env (default is all can read on Hydra)
- Export package list, they can import
  - Some pipelines use this method (qiime2, phyluce)

You can create an export file that has a listing of all the packages and chanels used in your environment.
This can be used with colleagues to create their own environment.
These exports are platform specific, so an environment created on Hydra will work on other Linux system, but might not work on Macs or Windows.

```
(blobtools)$ conda env export --name blobtools > blobtools.yml
$ head blobtools.yml

name: blobtools
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - _libgcc_mutex=0.1=conda_forge
  - _openmp_mutex=4.5=2_gnu
  - alsa-lib=1.2.8=h166bdaf_0
  - attr=2.5.1=h166bdaf_1
```

:alert: The list of channels is the current list from your settings, NOT what was used to do the actual installation.

You can then send that file to a collegue and they would create the environment with:

```
$ conda env create -f blobtools.yml --name blobtools-imported
```

If you don't specify `--name`, the orginally name of the exported environment will be used.

The channels specified in the `.yml` will be used, regardless of what the user has configured in their settings (`.condarc`).
:shipit: This needs to be confirmed

## Other topics

### Q: How do I use an enviornment that I created in my personal `conda` install?
If you were using conda on Hydra before this workshop, you can still use your previous conda installs.
The `conda activate` commnad will take a full path of an envionrment

```
$ conda activate ~/miniconda3/envs/amas
(amas) $
```

### Q: What's the best place to store my conda environments?
The default location in your home directory, `~/.conda/envs`, is fine. The envirnoments don't use much space
(typically 100M - 1GB, depending on the packages). The home directory is not scrubbed, which is essential
for software install directories.

:warning: The path to a conda environment shouldn't change after the envionrment is created. Some files
in the environment will have the path hard-coded into them. You can export and then import an 
environment to move it.

### Q. Can others use my conda environment
Yes. With the standard Hydra permissions, all-users will have read-only access to your environment.
They can use `conda activate /path/to/env` to activate your environment and use the installed software.

If they have permission issues, make sure the files are readable by all and executables+directories are executable by all.

One way to set those permissions is:

```
$ chmod -R a+r /path/to/env
$ find /path/to/env -executable -exec chmod a+x {} \;
```

## Common issues with `conda`

- SLOW: mamba as an alternative
- Errors you get if there are conflicting dependencies and package can't be installed?
- You install multiple packages, but you end up with an old version of packge (because of conflicting dependencies)
- The version of an available package is not the most recent the developer has released.
